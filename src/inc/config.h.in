/*
 * Revision 1.5  2013/09/10 -davin
 *
 * Read this. Yes, you, that person who wants to start scrolling down.
 * While a number of features used to be enabled through this file, many of them
 * have been moved to the ./configure script and should no longer be enabled here.
 *
 * Things that have been moved to ./configure include:
 *
 * SSL Support (--with-ssl)
 * MySQL Support (--with-mysql)
 * External Resolver (--enable-reslvd...which will be ignored in favor of the
 *                    threaded resolver anyway if your platform supports it)
 *
 *
 * Things that have been gutted entirely:
 *
 * VERBOSELOAD -- Use ./protomuck -verboseload instead.
 *
 * PROTO_AS_ROOT --  We really shouldn't endorse this at all. If you find
 * yourself needing to bind to a privileged port (usually 80), set up a proxy
 * in front of the game. In the case of a webserver, make sure you're logging the
 * X-Forwarded-For HTTP header so that you're tracking the actual client IP.
