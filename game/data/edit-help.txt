                   *ProtoMUCK MUF Editor Help*
While in the MUF editor, the following commands are available:

These commands are used to work with the program text:
----------------
compile             (c)     compile program
<num> [<num>]delete (d)     delete a single line or range of lines
<num> insert        (i)     insert at the line number given
<num> [<num>]list   (l)     list a single line, or a range of lines
uncompile           (u)     serves no point in current MUCK versions
numbers             (n)     toggle line numbers in program listings
publics             (p)     list words declared as PUBLIC
.                   (.)     enter . to exit insert mode
quit                (q)     exit and save changes to the MUF code
cancel              (x)     exit editor without saving any changes

These commands are used to work with the global MUF macros:
----------------
abridged [<letter>] (a)     list global MUF macros by name only
<macro name> kill   (k)     remove a global MUF macro (W1 Command)
show [<letter>]     (s)     list a full display of global MUF macros
<num> view          (v)     to list the given program's header

All editor commands may be abbreviated to their first letter.

To define a macro, use the following syntax:
def <macro name> <macro definition>
Then that macro may be used in any MUF program as:  .<macro name>

def sample me @ "Sample Macro" notify
would create a macro that notifies the user that string and is called
by using .sample in a MUF.
Be careful when defining a macro, as only w-bitted characters can
delete or change them.
