---- Changes from pre-2.x Neon as of Neon 2.0 ----

* First prototype of NWI (Neon Web Interface) is in place.
    - this allows a user without Pueblo to log in and still get
      multimedia.

* More MUF primitives cleaned up.

* Some 'ease of use' MPI and MUF for multimedia added...
    - commandtext
    - playmidi

* KEEPDUMPS cleaned up.

* First hooks for a potential Windows port added in place.

---- Changes from Neon 2.0 as of Neon 2.10 ----

* NWI cleaned up slightly.

* This version is mostly internal changes to allow easier compiling
  across different platforms.
    - SunOS/Solaris now compiles without too much trouble, although a
      slight manual change to autoconf.h is still needed after running
      the configure script.
    - WinNT/95 port works now!

* Some (undocumented, and possibly temporary) new MUF primitives added,
  to support arrays and socket controls.

---- Planned changes ---

Loki is talking to Foxen, the author of TinyMUCKfb, about establishing
some standards between the two MUCKs so that TinyMUCKfb, which will support
multimedia as well eventually, will be able to exchange code with NeonMuck.

This may necessitate a large revision, to 3.x, but will allow the standards
for arrays, sockets, etc to be fixed and then documented, since it will
then be a reasonable safe assumption they won't be changing.
