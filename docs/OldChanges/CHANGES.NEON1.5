---- Changes from normal TinyMUCKfb as of Neon 1.5, first release ----

REALLY MAJOR:
* Pueblo multimedia protocol support added.
  - 'PUEBLO' ($) flag added.
  - notify_html, notify_html_exclude, html_nocr, html_exclude_nocr
    MUF primitives added.
  - {html:} and {ohtml:} MPI added
* ANSI color support added.
  - 'COLOR' flag added to players.
  - ansi_notify MUF primitive added
  - {ansi:} MPI added.
* New MUCKER / WIZARD level system added.
  - see 'help newlevels'
* WWW server support added.
  - notify_descriptor (MAGE (M4) only) MUF primitive added.
  - Users can create homepages on themselves.
  - MUF programs can work as webpages as well.
* Combat/RPG support planned
  - MOBILE and ETHEREAL flags (currently unused by server) added for
    MUD-program use.

OF OTHER INTEREST:
* Program logs show user's mucker level.
* @/lockout-msg can be set on a player to prevent them from logging in...
  contents of this prop will be displayed and login rejected.
* Lots of new @tune parameters
* Online registration request hopper added.
* wizchat/wc added internally.
* Wizards can choose to not see wall_wizards messages
* Added setting to curtail building if DB hits a certain size
* Wizards can @name non-wizards without needing to @newpassword the user
* Dark rooms do not display contents even to owner.  Examine will still
  show all contents
* Fixed simple_look in look.c to not use (@desc) for the 'command @'
* _sys/lastcleantime added for cleanup intervals
* Added support for mortal use of !@ps
* Wizards cannot @force other wizards.  Period.
* MPI security holes patched.
* @/mage feeps added to allow select mortals higher-level use of certain
  commands.
* Wizards can teleport into player's inventories.  No, you can't ask why.
  Boredom, ok? :)
* MUF 'parseprop' now parses MPI _correctly_ to remove all non-printing 
  characters from result string.
* MUF 'moveto' prim now allows entry of vehicles without a wizbit.
* Wizard WHO list modified so there's more room for sitenames.
* 'Doing...' in normal WHO list is replaced by #0=_poll, if set.
* Fixed @tune to allow un-setting of dbref tune params.
* Added GUEST flag, restricted use of certain commands so characters set
  GUEST cannot use them.  Set this flag on twinks, too!  Note that MUF
  programs not locked against GUEST characters could potentially give them
  these powers back.
* Added a 'help' command to the login screen to spit back 'connect.txt'
  as opposed to welcome.txt.
* 'viewable' flag added.
* DARK flag on a player will send them ALL debug info for a MUF program
  they run.  HACK FOR DEBUGGING PURPOSES...(?)TEMPORARY(?)
* Andy made a truly garish default color scheme.  Watch out! :)
* Program changes by wizards are NOT logged to logs/programs.
  This saves an unbelievable amount of disk space.
* Nicer @stats and @proginfo
* Automatic character generation / e-mail based registration added.  Cool!
* Some sites, for real losers, can be COMPLETELY blocked.  Neon won't
  even output the login screen before dropping connection.
* {showlist} MPI primitive will print a list without running against the
  {list} length limit.
* A set of randomly cycled login screens!  Again, no, you can't ask why! ;)

INTERNAL:
* Fixed some logging issues.
* Hostname resolution in registration connection should work better now.
* Violated some C programming rules, but fixed dump_users() to not crash
  on long usernames.
* format_time() fixed.
