The Quick Guide On Setting Up The Hopper
----
The @hopper is fully functional, now.  To use the automated e-mail,
do the following:

@tune mailserver=<name or IP of an SMTP server you can use>
@tune servername=<name of the host your MUCK runs on>
@tune reg_email=<email address of char wizard>

@tuneing servername is recommended anyway, since HTMuf programs
for the webserver will probably begin to use this instead.

You must then create an lsedit list on #0, called @new-user-mail, e.g.:

lsedit #0=@new-user-mail

This is the body of the message that will be sent to a new user.
You can use %user% for the username, and %pass% for the password.

For example:

lsedit #0=@new-user-mail
Welcome to MyHappyMuck!
 
Your user, %user%, has been created with password %pass%.

We hope to see you aboard soon!
.end


Then, you have to @tune online_registration=yes

Now users can 'request <charname> <email> <real name>' and be put in a
'hopper'.  When you use the @hopper command to verify and create users,
they will be pcreated with a randomly generated password and sent a copy
of that mail (with %user% and %pass% replaced with their user and
password).

If you're a really open MUCK, you can @tune fast_registration=yes

Then the @hopper only records who has used request, because the users
will be created immediately upon request of a char (and mailed that
letter).

Enjoy!
